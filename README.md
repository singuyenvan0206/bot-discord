## 🎮 Fun & Games

## 🌐 Setting up the Language

The bot is fully localized! 
- The ultimate fallback language is `English`.
- If a server Administrator sets a language, everyone in the server sees that language.
- If a User sets a language explicitly, their personal preference will override the server.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `$lang server vi` | Changes the default language for the ENTIRE server to Vietnamese. (Requires Admin) |
| `$lang user en` | Sets your PERSONAL interface language to English. |
| `$lang reset` | Clears your personal setting to sync with the server default again. |
