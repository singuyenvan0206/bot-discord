## 🔡 Standalone Word Chain Bot

For servers wanting a dedicated 24/7 **Word Chain (Nối Chữ)** experience without the clutter of other commands, you can run the bot in Standalone Mode.

- **Independent Execution**: Runs on a separate process via `src/wc.js`.
- **Isolated Database**: Uses `wordchain.db` which only stores necessary user & guild data.
- **Continuous Play**: Players join by typing words directly; no prefix needed once a game starts in a channel.

**Run Standalone:**
```bash
npm run wc
```
